        the user is asking about the weather in Paris today. I need to figure out
        which function to use. The available tool is get_weather, which requires a
        location parameter. Paris is the city mentioned, and the country is France.
        So I should format the location as \"Paris, France\". Let me make sure there
        are no other parameters needed. The function only needs the location, so I''ll
        construct the tool call with that.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"chatcmpl-tool-2370633f184e43d8a700b78806cb1083","type":"function","function":{"name":"get_weather","arguments":"{\"location\":
