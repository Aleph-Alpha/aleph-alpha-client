class SummarizationRequest(NamedTuple):
    """
    Summarizes a document.

    Parameters:
        document (Document, required):
            A single document. This can be one of the following formats:

            - Docx: A base64 encoded Docx file
            - Text: A string of text
            - Prompt: A multimodal prompt, as is used in our other tasks like Completion

            Documents of types Docx and Text are usually preferred, and will have optimizations (such as chunking) applied to work better with the respective task that is being run.

            Prompt documents are assumed to be used for advanced use cases, and will be left as-is.

        disable_optimizations  (bool, default False)
            We continually research optimal ways to work with our models. By default, we apply these optimizations to both your query, documents, and answers for you.
            Our goal is to improve your results while using our API.
            But you can always pass `disable_optimizations: true` and we will leave your document and summary untouched.

    Examples
        >>> docx_file = "./tests/sample.docx"
        >>> document = Document.from_docx_file(docx_file)
        >>> request = SummarizationRequest(document)
