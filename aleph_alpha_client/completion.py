class CompletionRequest(NamedTuple):
    """
    Describes a completion request

    Parameters:
        prompt:
            The text or image prompt to be completed.
            Unconditional completion can be started with an empty string (default).
            The prompt may contain a zero shot or few shot task.

        maximum_tokens (int, optional, default 64):
            The maximum number of tokens to be generated.
            Completion will terminate after the maximum number of tokens is reached. Increase this value to generate longer texts.
            A text is split into tokens. Usually there are more tokens than words.
            The maximum supported number of tokens depends on the model (for luminous-base, it may not exceed 2048 tokens).
            The prompt's tokens plus the maximum_tokens request must not exceed this number.

        temperature (float, optional, default 0.0)
            A higher sampling temperature encourages the model to produce less probable outputs ("be more creative"). Values are expected in a range from 0.0 to 1.0. Try high values (e.g. 0.9) for a more "creative" response and the default 0.0 for a well defined and repeatable answer.

            It is recommended to use either temperature, top_k or top_p and not all at the same time. If a combination of temperature, top_k or top_p is used rescaling of logits with temperature will be performed first. Then top_k is applied. Top_p follows last.

        top_k (int, optional, default 0)
            Introduces random sampling from generated tokens by randomly selecting the next token from the k most likely options. A value larger than 1 encourages the model to be more creative. Set to 0 if repeatable output is to be produced.
            It is recommended to use either temperature, top_k or top_p and not all at the same time. If a combination of temperature, top_k or top_p is used rescaling of logits with temperature will be performed first. Then top_k is applied. Top_p follows last.

        top_p (float, optional, default 0.0)
            Introduces random sampling for generated tokens by randomly selecting the next token from the smallest possible set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability top_p. Set to 0.0 if repeatable output is to be produced.
            It is recommended to use either temperature, top_k or top_p and not all at the same time. If a combination of temperature, top_k or top_p is used rescaling of logits with temperature will be performed first. Then top_k is applied. Top_p follows last.

        presence_penalty (float, optional, default 0.0)
            The presence penalty reduces the likelihood of generating tokens that are already present in the text.
            Presence penalty is independent of the number of occurences. Increase the value to produce text that is not repeating the input.

        frequency_penalty (float, optional, default 0.0)
            The frequency penalty reduces the likelihood of generating tokens that are already present in the text.
            Frequency penalty is dependent on the number of occurences of a token.

        repetition_penalties_include_prompt (bool, optional, default False)
            Flag deciding whether presence penalty or frequency penalty are applied to the prompt and completion (True) or only the completion (False)

        use_multiplicative_presence_penalty (bool, optional, default True)
            Flag deciding whether presence penalty is applied multiplicatively (True) or additively (False). This changes the formula stated for presence and frequency penalty.

        best_of (int, optional, default None)
            Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.
            When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return â€“ best_of must be greater than n.

        n (int, optional, default 1)
            How many completions to generate for each prompt.

        logit_bias (dict mapping token ids to score, optional, default None)
            The logit bias allows to influence the likelihood of generating tokens. A dictionary mapping token ids (int) to a bias (float) can be provided. Such bias is added to the logits as generated by the model.

        log_probs (int, optional, default None)
            Number of top log probabilities to be returned for each generated token. Log probabilities may be used in downstream tasks or to assess the model's certainty when producing tokens.

        stop_sequences (List(str), optional, default None)
            List of strings which will stop generation if they're generated. Stop sequences may be helpful in structured texts.

            Example: In a question answering scenario a text may consist of lines starting with either "Question: " or "Answer: " (alternating). After producing an answer, the model will be likely to generate "Question: ". "Question: " may therfore be used as stop sequence in order not to have the model generate more questions but rather restrict text generation to the answers.

        tokens (bool, optional, default False)
            return tokens of completion

        disable_optimizations  (bool, optional, default False)
            We continually research optimal ways to work with our models. By default, we apply these optimizations to both your prompt and  completion for you.

            Our goal is to improve your results while using our API. But you can always pass disable_optimizations: true and we will leave your prompt and completion untouched.
