  Documents should also be constructible from actual Prompts and not only from sequences

## 3.5.0

## 3.1.2

### Bug fixes

- **AsyncClient**: Retry on ClientConnectionErrors as well.

## 3.1.1

### Bug Fixes

`PromptGranularity` for `ExplanationRequest`s is now an enum. This was previously just a type alias
for a union of literals but we felt that it would be more natural to have a dedicated enum.

## 3.1.0

### Features

### New `.explain()` method ðŸŽ‰

Better understand the source of a completion, specifically on how much each section of a prompt impacts the completion.

To get started, you can simply pass in a prompt you used with a model and the completion the model gave and generate an explanation:

```python
from aleph_alpha_client import Client, CompletionRequest, ExplanationRequest, Prompt

client = Client(token=os.environ["AA_TOKEN"])
prompt = Prompt.from_text("An apple a day, ")
model_name = "luminous-extended"

# create a completion request
request = CompletionRequest(prompt=prompt, maximum_tokens=32)
response = client.complete(request, model=model_name)

# generate an explanation
request = ExplanationRequest(prompt=prompt, target=response.completions[0].completion)
response = client.explain(request, model=model_name)
```

To visually see the results, you can also use this in our [Playground](https://app.aleph-alpha.com/playground/explanation).

We also have more [documentation and examples](https://docs.aleph-alpha.com/docs/tasks/explain/) available for you to read.

### AtMan (Attention Manipulation)

Under the hood, we are leveraging the method from our [AtMan paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08110) to help generate these explanations. And we've also exposed these controls anywhere you can submit us a prompt!

So if you have other use cases for attention manipulation, you can pass these AtMan controls as part of your prompt items.

```python
from aleph_alpha_client import Prompt, Text, TextControl

Prompt([
  Text("Hello, World!", controls=[TextControl(start=0, length=5, factor=0.5)]),
  Image.from_url(
    "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*HunNdlTmoPj8EKpl-jqvBA.png",
    controls=[ImageControl(top=0.25, left=0.25, height=0.5, width=0.5, factor=2.0)]
  )
])
```

For more information, check out our [documentation and examples](https://docs.aleph-alpha.com/docs/explainability/attention-manipulation/).

## 3.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- Removed deprecated `AlephAlphaClient` and `AlephAlphaModel`. Use `Client` or `AsyncClient` instead.
- Removed deprecated `ImagePrompt`. Import `Image` instead for image prompt items.

  - You only need to specify your documents, a query, and (optional) the max number of answers you want to receive.
  - You no longer specify a model.
- Removed "model" parameter from summarize method
- Removed "model_version" from `SummarizationResponse`

### Documentation

- Update documentation for `hosting` parameter

## 2.2.3

### Bugfix

- Remove `message` field from CompletionResult

## 2.2.2

### Bugfix

  - `penalty_exceptions_include_stop_sequences`

## 2.0.0

  Should not be an issue if you're not using semantic_embed from the client directly or if you're using keyword args.
