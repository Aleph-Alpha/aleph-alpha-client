# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming
prompt = """In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm of software that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates step by step, rather than on high-level descriptions of its expected results.

The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying all the details of how the program should achieve the result.[1]

Imperative and procedural programming

Procedural programming is a type of imperative programming in which the program is built from one or more procedures (also termed subroutines or functions). The terms are often used as synonyms, but the use of procedures has a dramatic effect on how imperative programs appear and how they are constructed. Heavy procedural programming, in which state changes are localized to procedures or restricted to explicit arguments and returns from procedures, is a form of structured programming. From the 1960s onwards, structured programming and modular programming in general have been promoted as techniques to improve the maintainability and overall quality of imperative programs. The concepts behind object-oriented programming attempt to extend this approach.

Procedural programming could be considered a step toward declarative programming. A programmer can often tell, simply by looking at the names, arguments, and return types of procedures (and related comments), what a particular procedure is supposed to do, without necessarily looking at the details of how it achieves its result. At the same time, a complete program is still imperative since it fixes the statements to be executed and their order of execution to a large extent."""
document = Document.from_text(prompt)

request = SummarizationRequest(document)

result = model.summarize(request)

print(result.summary)
```


### Summary with a multimodal prompt

import os

model = AlephAlphaModel(
    AlephAlphaClient(host="https://api.aleph-alpha.com", token=os.getenv("AA_TOKEN")),

prompt = [image]
document = Document.from_prompt(prompt)

request = SummarizationRequest(document)

result = model.summarize(request)

print(result.summary)

### Tokenize a text prompt


```python
from aleph_alpha_client import AlephAlphaClient, AlephAlphaModel, TokenizationRequest
import os

model = AlephAlphaModel(
    AlephAlphaClient(host="https://api.aleph-alpha.com", token=os.getenv("AA_TOKEN")),
    model_name = "luminous-extended"
)

# You need to choose a model with qa support and multimodal capabilities for this example.
request = TokenizationRequest(prompt="This is an example.", tokens=True, token_ids=True)
response = model.tokenize(request)

print(response)
```


### Detokenize a token IDs into text prompt


```python
from aleph_alpha_client import AlephAlphaClient, AlephAlphaModel, DetokenizationRequest
import os

model = AlephAlphaModel(
    AlephAlphaClient(host="https://api.aleph-alpha.com", token=os.getenv("AA_TOKEN")),
    model_name = "luminous-extended"
)

# You need to choose a model with qa support and multimodal capabilities for this example.
request = DetokenizationRequest(token_ids=[1730, 387, 300, 4377, 17])
response = model.detokenize(request)

print(response)
```


## Testing

Tests use pytests with (optional) coverage plugin. Install the locally cloned repo in editable mode with:

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
```

**Tests make api calls that reduce your quota!**

### Run tests

Tests can be run using pytest. Make sure to create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
# test settings
TEST_API_URL=https://test.api.aleph-alpha.com
TEST_MODEL=luminous-base
TEST_TOKEN=your_token
```

Instead of a token username and password can be used.

```env
# test settings
TEST_API_URL=https://api.aleph-alpha.com
TEST_MODEL=luminous-base
TEST_USERNAME=your_username
TEST_PASSWORD=your_password
```

* A coverage report can be created using the optional arguments --cov-report and --cov (see pytest documentation)
* A subset of tests can be selected by pointing to the module within tests

```bash
# run all tests, output coverage report of aleph_alpha_client module in terminal
pytest --cov-report term --cov=aleph_alpha_client tests
pytest tests -v # start verbose
```

If an html coverage report has been created a simple http server can be run to serve static files.

```bash
python -m http.server --directory htmlcov 8000
```

## Update README

> Do not change the README.md directly as it is generated from readme.ipynb 

To update the readme, do the following:

1. `pip install -e .[dev]`

2. Edit the notebook in your favorite jupyter editor and run all python cells to verify that the code examples still work.

3. To generate a new README.md first remove all output cells from the Jupyter notebook and then execute the command: `jupyter nbconvert --to markdown readme.ipynb --output README.md`
